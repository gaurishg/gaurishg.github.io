I am a aspiring software developer with 6 years of experience in C++ and Python (for academic use). I am currently pursuing my M.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Tokyo.

I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. I am a highly motivated and self-driven individual. I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges. I am also a team player and I enjoy working with others to achieve common goals.

I am looking for a challenging and rewarding software development position where I can use my skills and experience to make a positive impact.
